# BioCounter
Simple and easy to use program, to count various elements in biological science.

# # Goals.
The Goal is to make the program simple and easy to use.
I also would like to limit the use of external python modules to zero, but
some of those may be just necessary, thus I am going to limit the occurrences to absolute minimum.

# # Why Python.
I am aware that there are a lot of more suited programing languages for building
windows offline application than python, but it does not mean it can not be done.
Also I have used the Tkinter and ttk, because it is perceived as obsolete and useless
but it is far from true. There are modules like: pyQt, wxPython, kivy or pygame,
but for such simple use the Tkinter is sufficient and it is built in into python.
